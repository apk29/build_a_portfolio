You will be provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete throughout the course of your Nanodegree program.

The design mockup is located https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdfere.
